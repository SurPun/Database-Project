# Week 2: Database (F&C)
### By: Alex, Abby, Manoela & Suraj

A music sharing app where you can share your favourite songs for your friends!
This project is created with node.js

Have a look and post at [Heroku](https://songs-r.herokuapp.com/)

## Setup
Make sure you have Git and Node (v18) installed.

1. Clone this repo and cd into the directory

2. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies

3. Run `npm run dev` to start the server. Run `npm run dev-win` if using Windows.

4. Run `npm run seed` to create the database. Run `npm run seed-win` if using Windows.

This uses the nodemon library to auto-restart the server when you save changes.

## Test

`npm run test:1`

- To test in Windows run:

`npm run test:1-win`


## User stories

### Core

- [x] As a friendly user I want to post a song that I like for anyone to see
- [x] As a curious user I want to see other people's favourite songs they posted about

Stretch goal: 
- [ ] As a selfish user, I want to filter by user so I can see a collection of one person's favourite songs
- [ ] As an organised user, I want to sort all posted songs by rating

## Schema

Our database contains two tables.
1. Users - contains the usernames of everyone who has posted their favourite song so far
2. Music - a list of all songs posted

The two tables follow the schema as shown below
